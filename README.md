## JIRA-CLI with some small customisations


```bash
# jira token for jira-cli repository:
#
# from https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli
# ? Link to Jira server: https://company.atlassian.net
# ? Login email: darker@company.com

$ export JIRA_API_TOKEN="------"
```

And we're good to go, all aliases are available during the image built.
